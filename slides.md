#### What?

  > AWS CloudFormation enables you to create and provision AWS infrastructure deployments predictably and repeatedly.



  - Infrastructre as Code (IaC)
  - Declarative, High Level Syntax

---

#### Why?

  spend less time managing resources and more time focusing on your apps



  - Simplify infrastructure management
  - Quickly replicate your infrastructure
  - Easily control and track changes to your infrastructure

---

#### How?

AWS CloudFormation enables you to use a template file to create and delete a collection of resources together as a single unit (a stack).

---

#### Configure

Use it through

  - AWS Console
  - AWS CLI



No config required for Console.

For CLI, set up AWS credentials.

---

#### Concepts

Declare the Resources you want, CloudFormation will create it for you.



  - Template
  - Stack
  - ChangeSet

##### Resources

Each resource block describes one or more infrastructure objects, such as virtual networks, compute instances, or higher-level components such as DNS records.



##### Template

A JSON or YAML file that declares the infrastructure resources to be created.



##### Stack

A single unit that represents the resources created by a template.



##### ChangeSet

A preview of changes to be made to your exisiting stack.



##### StackSet

Stacks across multiple accounts and AWS Regions with a single operation.
